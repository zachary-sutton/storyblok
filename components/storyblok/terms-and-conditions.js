                        NEED TO MOVE YOUR FLIGHT?
                        To give you extra flexibility in these uncertain times, we are currently waiving the flight change fee for changes made up to 14 days before departure. For changes less than 14 days before departure, we are also currently reducing our peak season fee so that our off-peak fee applies even during peak season. Other change fees may apply for changes made after the current fee waiver has ended. Standard terms and conditions apply to all changes. If the new fare is higher you will be required to pay the fare difference. No credit is given if the new fare is lower. All changes must be made at least 2 hours before departure.
